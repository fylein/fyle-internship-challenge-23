## Unit Test

Unit tests are an essential part of the development process to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application. While there is no dedicated `tests` directory in this repository, you are encouraged to write unit tests for your Angular components, services, and other relevant parts of your application.

To run the unit tests, you can use the Angular CLI command:
